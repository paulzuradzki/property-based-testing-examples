# `encoder`

# Description

A small package for [run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) (RLE).

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run.
